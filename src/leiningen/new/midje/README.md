I'm a really sweet app/library. I'll be developed in a TDD'd style with
[Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje/))

## How to run the tests

`lein midje` will run all tests.

`lein midje --lazytest` will run all the tests indefinitely. It sets up a
watcher on the code files and if they change only the relevant tests will be
run again.
